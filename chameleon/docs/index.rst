Chameleon
=========

Chameleon is an XML attribute language template compiler. It comes
with implementations for the Zope Page Templates (ZPT) and Genshi
languages.

The engine compiles templates into Python byte-code. This results in
performance which is on average 10-15 times better than implementation
which use runtime interpretation. Real-world application benchmarks
show an overall performance improvement in complex applications of
30-50%.

Releases are available on PyPi. To get the latest release::

  $ easy-install -U Chameleon
